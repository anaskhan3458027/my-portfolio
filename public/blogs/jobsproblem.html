    <h1>Jobs Problem: Fresher are asked for experience from company side?</h1>

    <div class="content">
      <p>
        This is a common problem faced by many fresh graduates. Companies often look for candidates who have experience in the field,
        yet freshers don't have that experience. This leads to a challenging situation for young professionals trying to enter the workforce.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The real question is: How can freshers gain experience if no company is willing to give them a chance? 
        This issue continues to plague the job market, with many graduates feeling stuck in a cycle of rejection.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Companies may have their reasons for asking for experience, such as a desire to reduce training costs and ensure that new hires can hit the ground running. 
        However, this approach often excludes talented individuals who are capable of learning quickly and contributing meaningfully with the right guidance.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        For freshers, this may mean getting creativeâ€”by taking internships, freelance gigs, or building their own projects to demonstrate their skills.
        The key is to find ways to showcase potential, even in the absence of professional experience.
